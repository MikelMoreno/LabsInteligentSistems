# =======================================================================
# 1. Be sure to include, with this template, any necessary files
#    for execution, including datasets (problem.R, methodXXX.R, ...)
#    (submission of the entire template folder is recommended)
# 2. If you use a function of a certain package, do not forget to include the
#    corresponding call to the "library ()" function
# 3. Do not forget to comment on the code, especially those non-trivial commands
#    (remember that part of the rating depends on the cleaning of the code)
# 4. It is strongly recommended to test any implemented function in order to 
#    check for its proper operation
# =======================================================================
# (This is a general code, you must adapt it)
